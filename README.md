# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis

I undertook an in-depth analysis of e-commerce sales data and created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI. The dataset used for this project was sourced from a CSV file(https://www.kaggle.com) and includes the following columns:

- Order Date
- Ship Date
- Ship Mode
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Segment
- City
- State
- Country
- Postal Code
- Market
- Region
- Product ID
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Product Name
- Sales
- Quantity
- Discount
- Shipping Cost
- Profit
- Order Priority

My analysis aimed to uncover valuable insights and trends within the e-commerce sales domain by establishing relationships between the various columns. Key findings and visualizations included:

1. **Sales Performance**: Visualizations depicting sales trends over time, allowing for the identification of seasonal patterns and overall growth.
2. **Profit Analysis**: Insights into profit margins across different product categories, sub-categories, and regions, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Utilizing the 'Segment' column to understand the distribution of customers and their impact on sales and profitability.
4. **Shipping Analysis**: Visualization of shipping costs and their impact on overall profitability, potentially identifying areas for optimization.
5. **Market and Regional Insights**: Understanding sales performance across different markets and regions, potentially uncovering opportunities for expansion or targeted marketing efforts.

By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I created an intuitive dashboard that allows for easy exploration and interpretation of the data. My analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of e-commerce sales dynamics and provides actionable insights for stakeholders within the industry.
